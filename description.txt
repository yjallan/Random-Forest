In this Random Forest implementation, I have modified the Util.py file to get the information_gain.
Decision_tree.py is modified to create a decision tree.
In the Random Forset.py, I have implemented bootstrapping to generate random datasets to train.
I've used the default value of the size of forest as 10.
For testing, I've run it through all the trees and report the label chosen by majority of trees.

Accuracy is 0.9605
OOB error is 1 - 0.9605 = 0.0395
